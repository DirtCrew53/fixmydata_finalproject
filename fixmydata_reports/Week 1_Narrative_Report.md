# Introduction

The **FixMyData** project focuses on designing and developing a Python library dedicated to data cleaning. The primary goal is to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to address common data preprocessing challenges such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, detecting outliers, and validating dataset quality. This project also reinforces teamwork, documentation, version control, and collaborative software development.

# Objectives of the Week

* Understand and outline the structure of the FixMyData Python library.
* Apply OOP concepts including abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
* Implement core classes such as `DataCleaner`, `DataValidator`, `StatsEngine`, and `CorrelationEngine`.
* Draft project documentation and UML diagrams.
* Collaborate effectively through GitHub for version control.
* Conduct testing and basic packaging preparation.

# Narrative of Activities

Throughout the week, the group collaborated to finalize the architecture of the library. We defined the relationships between classes and identified necessary methods and attributes for each component. Additionally, we drafted the UML diagram prompt, prepared documentation, and assigned roles to ensure balanced contribution.

The team also performed pair programming sessions to implement class structures, debug potential issues, and ensure the codebase adhered to best practices. By the end of the week, we had a fully drafted library structure and accompanying documentation.

# Challenges Encountered

* Determining clear class responsibilities to avoid overlapping functionalities.
* Ensuring consistent naming conventions and coding styles across contributors.
* Understanding abstract classes and designing appropriate method overrides.
* Managing local and remote Git repository changes during simultaneous edits.

# Reflection and Learning

The project strengthened our understanding of how OOP principles enhance code organization, scalability, and maintainability. We also developed a deeper appreciation for collaborative tools such as GitHub and documentation practices that support professional software development.

Working on data cleaning as a core theme also highlighted the importance of preprocessing in data science workflows, reinforcing that clean and validated data is foundational for meaningful analysis.
